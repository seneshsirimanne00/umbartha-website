    para: "I am a middle aged woman, married, with kids, I realized that I had difficulty trusting people due to various unpleasant experiences in my life. I was especially unable to get over hurt caused by a close family member due to a particular incident and remembering it brings pain even now. I just couldn’t forgive that person and the resentment was costing my happiness and freedom to live peacefully. My counselor was able to listen to my story with love and I felt very comfortable sharing my experience without any inhibitions.  She used the EMDR method to help me. I was able to resolve the pain and the anger that I had towards the person who had hurt me. I feel much happier and I don’t have any bitterness towards anyone one now. I am also working on my trust issues. I am in a better place now than before I sought help!",

    para: "Married for 24 years with two 2 children we began drifting apart some years ago and the love and understanding we had when we married began to vanish!  We just ended up finding fault with each other and every small matter became the basis for arguments and even fights.  We realized that the toxic environment was causing a lot of stress and anxiety to our kids and they too were falling apart. We sought help. Our Counselor was extremely patient with us. She gave us time and space . She was able to  give us her complete attention to listen to both sides of our stories. She was unbiased and we didn’t feel judged. Although it took a while for both us to come to a common ground and begin to resolve our issues, we are glad that we got help through practical and relevant counsel. We have begun to love and respect each other again. We are able to understand each other better, which in turn brings peace in the family.",

      "Without the help, guidance and the strength I’ve got from her as a counselor I wouldn’t have come this far in my life.",
    para: "I was a very loving and caring wife to my husband and did everything to please him in every way that he wanted.In 2014 he took me to a friend of ours who was counseling couples as I had become confused and depressed about our marriage and wanted out.Though we had known her since 2001, that evening was different and it started the change in my life.While by this time everyone thought we were in a happy marriage and were a very open minded and generous couple the truth was very different.As I opened up in sessions I was able to speak the truth about our marriage for the first time and when all the secrets started to come out openly I started to feel a sense of freedom that I’d never experienced before. I realized that I had been a willing victim of an abusive husband. I had kept quiet for years due to my family and my children as well as the cultural and even religious expectations with which I had grown up – like most women in my position. I felt humiliation and shame as I was helped to dig deep into my feelings. At the end of it all though I experienced freedom and peace. I was able to confront my husband as an abuser and I was able to admit that I was in an abusive and toxic relationship.When I realized that my husband just did not intend changing and there was no hope that I would be free of the emotional, physical and sexual abuse I had to endure at his hands I went ahead with first separation and the divorce proceedings It was a very painful experience but my counselor stood by me and I was able to lean on her. Each time I left our sessions I did so with a much lighter heart and a more relaxed mind than I had when I had started.Without the help, guidance and the strength I’ve got from her as a counselor I wouldn’t have come this far in my life. I’ve learned to say “No” to what I do not agree with, no matter how much I love a person, and she has also helped me to learn to keep healthy boundaries in my life that I couldn’t before.I am now also able to help others who are going through what I went through in a similar way.",

    para: "Counseling for me is essentially being able to speak your mind- the good, bad and the ugly without holding anything in. You then start to hear things out loud that you wouldn’t otherwise know is in your head. With the right counselor you are able to process these emotions positively without having the fear of being judged and that is what I was able to do with Manisha. I felt heard and understood every time I had a session and that in my opinion, is one of the most important elements in counseling.",

      "The biggest plus point is her complete and honest attention towards every truth that you discover about yourself. ",
    para: "Overwhelmed by depression and stress, I sought friends, neighbors, legal advisors, strangers, and online therapists in an attempt to get a grasp of my emotions and sinking self. Nothing seemed to help. After months of struggling emotionally, I got in touch with Manisha Billimoria. And, I had to look no further. I found an anchor in her to tide over the overwhelming phase of my life.I do believe she was God-sent. In just one session, I felt a strong sense of hope. Through her sound knowledge and extensive experience, she was able to guide me to a place of understanding, of what was truly troubling me, to understand the reality of the situation, and equip me with tools and aids to handle my emotional triggers. I can’t thank her enough for guiding me to a place of healing and recovery. The entire experience seems seamless – booking an appointment, the length of time set for the session, the time zone difference, the zoom connection, the personal connect, and the follow-ups. The biggest plus point is her complete and honest attention towards every truth that you discover about yourself. She makes notes, shares a summary of your progress, and helps you refer to it as a map of recovery. She is truly gifted and I will highly recommend her as the go to person – if one is looking for a therapist. And lastly, she has an innate warmth in her interactions with you. Which sets her apart from all other therapists that I have sought. I look forward to meeting her in person as soon as international travel is back to usual.",

      "She had many follow ups with me just to understand whether I’m uplifting my emotional stability or going back to helplessness, she in fact offered me frequent support and with merely two months into the process I could feel a real difference in the way I looked at my problem. ",
    para: " As a newly married wife who fulfilled every duty lovingly to her husband, yet to receive negativity throughout in return was hard for me to carry. I found myself drowning in helplessness and mild depression day by day. Initially the days were spent with tears but as the time went by I had no more emotions to show but was living with the flow. This was the time when one of my friends recommended me to go for counseling with Manisha. That was the wisest decision I took. Though my family and friends were open minded regarding this matter, I wanted to know the perspective of an outsider to understand whether I have done anything wrong to create the situation or whether I have any more room for a change. Manisha was so accommodating and patient to listen to my sorrow during the sessions and she always made sure that I was given a valuable piece of advice to take home, which could uplift my mental state. She had many follow ups with me just to understand whether I’m uplifting my emotional stability or going back to helplessness, she in fact offered me frequent support and with merely two months into the process I could feel a real difference in the way I looked at my problem. Even to date whenever I get a negative reflection of past events I know to cover it up with many positives which were fed to me by her, for that I’m forever grateful!",

    para: "I went to Manisha when there were a few issues in my life which were both unresolved and overwhelming; issues that even stemmed from my childhood. I was skeptical of meeting a counsellor due to a bad experience before, but Manisha completely changed my mind.She was both welcoming and was open to listening to what I had to say with zero judgment. She helped me descent the problems I had at that time – from parents to a recent miscarriage to stresses at work and life in general.She guided me through a series of sessions, to understand and accept certain situations, and to change my perception on things. That approach has also helped me look at things different now. So not only did it help my situation at that point, but it also helps me now whenever I get agitated over an issue. So thank you Manisha for being you, and guiding me to resolve whatever that was bothering me, and to look at life in a different way. ",

    para: "I started talking to Manisha back in 2019. I was 26 and was going through a divorce. When I first met with her I knew that I was in a really bad place mentally because in addition to having to deal with a divorce I also had to deal with pressure from my family. I remember feeling really lost and depressed. I had trouble concentrating and remembering anything and this was very challenging because it affected my work. Talking to Manisha changed my life. I learnt that I was a lot more stronger than I gave myself credit for. With time, I was able to get my confidence back, and focus on myself and become a more positive person. And I really think that my sessions with Manisha have helped me see the world in a different light. I am so grateful to her for helping me during one of the hardest times in my life.",
