            MOMS - Making our motherhood significant

                Among the many changes taking place in the social fabric of Sri
                Lanka, the growing segment within the female population that
                needs special care and help is apparent and cannot be ignored.
                This segment comprises mothers who are raising their children
                alone and taking up both the roles of both mother and father –
                ‘Single Mums’.
                <br />
                <br /> Single mums are courageous women who step up by
                themselves to do the job of two, and face life’s challenges
                boldly for the sake of their children. They take on multiple
                roles of being provider, caretaker, nurturer, teacher, protector
                and above all the ever-present help to their children. While it
                is easy to pen these multiple roles down all-in-one sentence,
                fulling these roles in real life requires determination,
                commitment and selflessness which are evidently attributes of
                single mums. However, the daunting task of fulfilling multiple
                responsibilities and making ends meet in today’s challenging
                environment can sometimes be exhausting and overwhelming.
                <br />
                <br /> That is why we at Umbartha (Beyond Thresholds) would like
                to join hands with these super women and provide them and their
                children with the moral and emotional support that they need to
                “keep on keeping on”.
                <br />
                <br /> ‘Making Our Motherhood Significant’ or ‘MOMS’ is an
                initiative designed to empower, enhance and enrich the lives of
                single mums and their children and help them to work through a
                wide range of issues and challenges that they face.
                <br />
                <br /> A series of 6 workshops will be conducted fortnightly by
                professionally trained facilitators. While the mums attend the
                workshop on the topic of the day, their kids too will attend a
                session especially tailored for them on the same topic. What is
                unique about this program is this two-pronged approach which
                equips the mums and their children to face their challenges and
                overcome them together. Times of fellowship and fun activities
                are woven into the program to ensure a good balance of work and
                play for both the mums and the children! <br />
                <br /> Umbartha invites single mums to register for the MOMS
                program and start this journey of togetherness with us. See you
                at the threshold…

                Counseling for me is essentially being able to speak your mind-
                the good, bad and the ugly without holding anything in. You then
